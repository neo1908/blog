# Doomsday Recovery

This page serves as a dumping ground for ideas on preserving access to online ( and offline ) accounts in the event of disaster

## General Principles

* All passwords are stored in a password safe ( KeePass )
* Password safe lives on the NAS and is backed up once per day to a spare nas
* primary NAS is backed up once per week to B2 Storage


### TODOs

- [ ] Consider a way to ensure access with TOTP codes
- [ ] Ensure duplicate yubikeys are used
- [ ] Automate as much as possible
- [ ] Document
- [ ] Practice
